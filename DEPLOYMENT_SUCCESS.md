## 🔧 Technical Capabilities Demonstrated

### Real-Time Event Processing
- **Kinesis Stream**: Ingests security events in real-time
- **Lambda Trigger**: Processes events with <5 second latency
- **Scalable Architecture**: Can handle thousands of events/second

### Advanced Analytics
- **Risk Scoring**: 0-100 algorithm based on severity, IP reputation, time
- **Threat Intelligence**: IP blacklist checking and reputation scoring  
- **Geo-location**: IP address enrichment with location data
- **Event Classification**: CloudTrail, GuardDuty, custom event parsing

### Data Lake Architecture
- **S3 Partitioning**: `year=2025/month=07/day=22/hour=22/`
- **JSON Storage**: Human-readable format for analysis
- **Lifecycle Management**: Automatic data expiration after 30 days
- **Encryption**: AES-256 server-side encryption

### Alerting & Response
- **SNS Integration**: Email alerts for high-risk events (score ≥70)
- **Alert Enrichment**: Risk details, recommendations, event context
- **Severity Classification**: HIGH (≥80), MEDIUM (70-79), LOW (<70)

## 💰 Cost Analysis

### Monthly Operating Costs
| Component | Cost | Optimization |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| Kinesis (1 shard) | $10.80 | Minimal required |
| Lambda (256MB) | $0.50-2 | 50% memory reduction |
| S3 Storage | $1-5 | 30-day lifecycle |
| CloudTrail | $2-5 | Management events free |
| CloudWatch Logs | $0.50-1 | 7-day retention |
| KMS | $1 | Required for encryption |
| SNS | $0.10 | Minimal usage |
| **GuardDuty** | **$0** | **Disabled (-$30-100)** |
| **Total** | **$15-25** | **70% savings** |

### Cost Optimization Strategies Applied
1. **GuardDuty Disabled**: Primary cost savings, can enable for demos
2. **Reduced Lambda Memory**: 256MB vs 512MB (50% execution cost reduction)
3. **Shorter Retention**: 30 days vs 90 days, 7-day logs vs 14 days
4. **Simplified Lifecycle**: Removed complex tiering for portfolio use

## 🚀 Production Readiness

### Ready to Scale
