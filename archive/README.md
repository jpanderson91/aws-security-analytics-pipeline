# ðŸ“¦ Archive Directory

This directory contains files that were moved during repository cleanup to create a cleaner, more intuitive experience for visitors.

## ðŸ“‹ **Archived Files**

### **CAP Setup Files**
- `cap-launch.json` - VS Code launch configuration for CAP demo
- `cap-requirements.txt` - Python dependencies for CAP demo  
- `cap-tasks.json` - VS Code tasks for CAP demo
- `cap-vscode-settings.json` - VS Code settings for CAP demo
- `cap-workspace.code-workspace` - Multi-folder workspace configuration

### **Setup Scripts**
- `setup_cap_demo.ps1` - Original CAP demo setup script
- `setup_cap_demo_fixed.ps1` - Updated CAP demo setup script
- `test_cap_environment.py` - Environment validation script

### **Development Artifacts**
- `CAP_DEMO_CONTEXT.md` - Original CAP demo project context and requirements
- `consolidated/` - Experimental consolidated project structure

## ðŸŽ¯ **Why Archived?**

These files were moved to:
1. **Reduce confusion** for repository visitors
2. **Create clear entry points** (main README and cap-demo-enhancement)
3. **Preserve development history** while cleaning up the main view
4. **Focus attention** on the working, validated projects

## ðŸ”§ **Current Working Projects**

- **Basic Pipeline**: Use the main repository structure and README
- **CAP Demo**: Use the [`cap-demo-enhancement/`](../cap-demo-enhancement/) directory

The archived files remain available for reference but are not needed for deployment or demonstration.

---

**Note**: All working functionality has been preserved in the main repository structure and the cap-demo-enhancement directory.
