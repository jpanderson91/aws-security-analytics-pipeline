## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- Terraform >= 1.0
- Python 3.8+
- PowerShell (Windows) or Bash (Linux/Mac)

### Deployment
1. **Validate Environment**:
   ```bash
   python tests/run_complete_validation.py --quick-check
   ```

2. **Deploy Infrastructure**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/setup_phase1_msk.py
   python scripts/setup_phase2_processing.py
   python scripts/setup_phase3_analytics.py
   ```

3. **Run Demo**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/run_full_demo.py
   ```

## Validation Status

This enhanced version includes:
- âœ… **AWS Credential Resolution**: Environment variable-based authentication
- âœ… **Terraform Validation**: All 135 resources planned successfully
- âœ… **Module Interfaces**: Fixed ECS and Lambda module parameters
- âœ… **Windows Compatibility**: PowerShell scripts and path handling

## Integration with Original Project

This enhancement preserves all original functionality while adding:
- Professional demo capabilities
- Enhanced automation and validation
- Comprehensive documentation
- Operational monitoring and cost management
- Customer-facing APIs and integration examples

The original project remains the foundation, and this enhancement can be used for:
- Live demonstrations to technical stakeholders
- Professional portfolio showcasing
- Customer proof-of-concept deployments
- Training and educational purposes

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to AWS**: Use the three-phase deployment scripts
2. **Record Demo**: Follow the demo script for professional presentation
3. **Customer Integration**: Use the APIs for customer demonstrations
4. **Ongoing Operations**: Use validation scripts for health monitoring

This enhanced version represents a production-ready, demo-capable evolution of the original AWS Security Analytics Pipeline.
