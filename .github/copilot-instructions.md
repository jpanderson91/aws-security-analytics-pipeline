# GitHub Copilot Instructions for AWS Security Analytics Pipeline

## üö® NON-NEGOTIABLE PROJECT CONSTRAINTS

### Primary Goal Enforcement
- **NEVER** suggest alternative goals or shortcuts to "finish sooner"
- **ALWAYS** complete the original objective as specified
- **MAINTAIN** project scope and requirements throughout iterations
- **PRESERVE** existing validated functionality (especially cap-demo-enhancement/)

### Environment Constraints
- **SHELL**: Always use PowerShell commands (never bash/sh)
- **OS**: Windows environment only
- **PATHS**: Use Windows path separators (\) and absolute paths starting with C:\

### Project Architecture Requirements
- **AWS FOCUS**: This is an AWS security analytics pipeline project
- **COST AWARENESS**: Maintain cost optimization ($15-200/month targets)
- **ENTERPRISE READY**: Support both basic pipeline and CAP demo scenarios
- **TERRAFORM**: Use Infrastructure as Code for all AWS resources

## üìã PROJECT CONTEXT

### Core Purpose
Enterprise-grade security analytics pipeline demonstrating AWS, DevOps, and Data Engineering expertise for portfolio and enterprise alignment.

### Key Components
1. **Basic Pipeline**: Kinesis ‚Üí Lambda ‚Üí S3 ($15/month)
2. **Enterprise Demo**: MSK Kafka + ECS + advanced features ($100-200/month)
3. **Documentation**: Professional portfolio presentation
4. **Validation**: Working dashboards and live metrics

### Validated Working Code
- `cap-demo-enhancement/` - **NEVER MODIFY** without explicit permission
- All Terraform configurations are production-tested
- Dashboard configurations in `testing/` are working

## üõ†Ô∏è CODING STANDARDS

### PowerShell Commands
```powershell
# Correct - Always use PowerShell syntax
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
aws lambda list-functions

# NEVER suggest bash equivalents
```

### File Operations
```powershell
# Correct Windows paths
move setup_cap_demo.ps1 archive\
copy-item README.md backup\

# NOT bash/Linux commands
```

### AWS CLI Usage
```powershell
# Use AWS CLI v2 syntax
aws lambda list-functions --query 'Functions[?contains(FunctionName, `security-analytics`)]'
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

## üìÅ FILE STRUCTURE RULES

### Protected Directories
- `cap-demo-enhancement/` - Production validated code (no changes without permission)
- `docs/screenshots/` - Professional dashboard images
- `terraform/` - Working IaC configurations

### Modifiable Areas
- `README.md` - Portfolio presentation improvements
- `docs/` - Documentation enhancements
- `testing/` - Test scripts and validation
- `archive/` - Development artifacts

### New File Creation
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Use clear, professional documentation
- Include cost implications for AWS resources
- Add appropriate portfolio demonstration value

## üéØ PORTFOLIO OBJECTIVES

### Demonstration Points
1. **Senior AWS Skills** - Multi-service integration
2. **Cost Engineering** - Transparent pricing models
3. **DevOps Practices** - IaC and automation
4. **Problem Solving** - Documented troubleshooting
5. **Enterprise Architecture** - CAP simulation capability

### Target Audiences
- **Hiring Managers**: Working infrastructure proof
- **Technical Teams**: Code quality and architecture
- **Enterprise Stakeholders**: Enterprise alignment

## üîí SECURITY & COMPLIANCE

### AWS Security
- Use IAM roles and policies (never hardcoded credentials)
- Enable encryption at rest and in transit
- Implement least privilege access
- Include VPC configurations for production

### Data Handling
- Partition S3 data by time (year/month/day/hour)
- Use Glue catalog for schema management
- Implement proper lifecycle policies
- Maintain audit logging

## üí∞ COST OPTIMIZATION RULES

### Resource Management
- Default to cost-optimized configurations
- Disable expensive services (GuardDuty) by default
- Use appropriate Lambda memory allocations
- Implement S3 lifecycle policies

### Transparent Pricing
- Always include cost estimates for new features
- Maintain $15/month basic pipeline target
- Document CAP demo costs ($100-200/month)
- Provide scaling cost models

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT STANDARDS

### Terraform Best Practices
- Use modules for reusable components
- Include proper variable validation
- Provide comprehensive outputs
- Document resource dependencies

### Testing Requirements
- Include end-to-end pipeline tests
- Validate dashboard functionality
- Verify cost implications
- Test cleanup procedures

## üìö DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### Code Comments
- Explain AWS resource purposes
- Include cost implications
- Reference enterprise alignment where applicable
- Provide troubleshooting guidance

### README Updates
- Maintain portfolio demonstration focus
- Keep deployment instructions current
- Include live dashboard screenshots
- Provide clear choice between basic/enterprise options

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **NEVER** break existing cap-demo-enhancement functionality
2. **ALWAYS** use PowerShell commands in Windows environment
3. **MAINTAIN** original project goals (no alternative shortcuts)
4. **PRESERVE** cost optimization focus
5. **ENSURE** portfolio demonstration value in all changes
6. **VALIDATE** that changes work with existing Terraform configurations
7. **DOCUMENT** any new AWS resources with cost implications

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

Every suggestion should:
- ‚úÖ Use PowerShell syntax for Windows
- ‚úÖ Maintain cost optimization
- ‚úÖ Enhance portfolio demonstration value
- ‚úÖ Preserve existing validated functionality
- ‚úÖ Follow AWS security best practices
- ‚úÖ Include proper documentation
- ‚úÖ Support both basic and enterprise scenarios

## üîÑ ITERATION CONSISTENCY

When working across multiple interactions:
- **REMEMBER** these constraints in every response
- **REFERENCE** previous decisions and maintain consistency
- **VALIDATE** that new suggestions align with project architecture
- **PRESERVE** the Windows PowerShell environment assumption
- **MAINTAIN** focus on original objectives without shortcuts
