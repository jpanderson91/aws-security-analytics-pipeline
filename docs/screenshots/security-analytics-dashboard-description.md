This image shows the main analytics dashboard with:
- Lambda Function Performance: Live metrics showing invocations, duration, errors, and throttles
- Kinesis Stream Activity: Real-time data flow with incoming/outgoing records and bytes
- S3 Data Lake Growth: Daily storage metrics (note: shows "No data available" as expected for new buckets)
- Security Alerts: SNS message publication metrics
- Data Lake Status: Real-time confirmation showing 12 objects created
- Note: Pipeline is actively processing events as evidenced by the metrics

Key highlights:
âœ… Lambda processing 173ms duration with active invocations
âœ… Kinesis showing 3.03k data throughput
âœ… Real-time status widget confirms 12 S3 objects created
âœ… Pipeline is working correctly with data partitioning by date/hour
