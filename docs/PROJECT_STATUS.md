## 🎤 **Interview Talking Points**

1. **Problem-Solving Approach**: "When dashboards showed 'no data,' I systematically diagnosed the issue, generated test data, and fixed configuration problems."

2. **End-to-End Thinking**: "Built complete pipeline from data ingestion through processing to visualization, with monitoring at every stage."

3. **DevOps Best Practices**: "Organized code structure, comprehensive documentation, issue tracking, and version control throughout."

4. **AWS Expertise**: "Leveraged multiple AWS services in a cohesive architecture, understanding service interactions and limitations."

5. **Real-World Problem Solving**: "Handled typical CloudWatch metric delays, dashboard configuration issues, and testing scenarios that occur in production environments."
