# üì∑ Screenshot Upload Instructions

## üéØ **Step-by-Step Guide to Add Dashboard Screenshots**

### **Step 1: Copy Screenshots to Repository**

Run these commands in PowerShell to copy your screenshots:

```powershell
# Navigate to your repository
cd "C:\Users\jpand\Downloads\aws-security-analytics-pipeline-new"

# Copy screenshots from Pictures folder to docs/screenshots
# Replace the actual screenshot filenames with your files
Copy-Item "C:\Users\jpand\Pictures\Screenshots\*.png" "docs\screenshots\"

# OR copy specific files with better names:
Copy-Item "C:\Users\jpand\Pictures\Screenshots\Screenshot1.png" "docs\screenshots\security-analytics-dashboard.png"
Copy-Item "C:\Users\jpand\Pictures\Screenshots\Screenshot2.png" "docs\screenshots\security-metrics-dashboard.png"
Copy-Item "C:\Users\jpand\Pictures\Screenshots\Screenshot3.png" "docs\screenshots\cost-tracking-dashboard.png"
```

### **Step 2: Add Screenshots to Git**

```powershell
# Add all screenshots to git
git add docs/screenshots/

# Check what will be committed
git status

# Commit the screenshots
git commit -m "üì∏ Add CloudWatch dashboard screenshots

‚úÖ PORTFOLIO DOCUMENTATION ENHANCED:
- Security Analytics Dashboard screenshot
- Security Metrics Dashboard screenshot  
- Cost Tracking Dashboard screenshot
- README with screenshot documentation

üéØ Ready for portfolio demonstration and interviews"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### **Step 3: Update Documentation (I'll help with this)**

After you upload the screenshots, I'll help you:
1. Update the main README.md to include screenshot previews
2. Add screenshot references to PROJECT_STATUS.md
3. Update DASHBOARD_VALIDATION.md with visual confirmations

## üìù **Recommended Screenshot Names**

If you want to rename your screenshots for better organization:

- `security-analytics-dashboard.png` - Main analytics dashboard
- `security-metrics-dashboard.png` - Real-time metrics dashboard
- `cost-tracking-dashboard.png` - Cost optimization dashboard
- `dashboard-list.png` - CloudWatch dashboards list view (optional)

## üéØ **What Screenshots Should Show**

Make sure your screenshots capture:
- ‚úÖ **Working widgets** with actual data (not "No data available")
- ‚úÖ **Time range** set to "Last 3 hours" or similar
- ‚úÖ **Clean browser** without personal information
- ‚úÖ **Full dashboard** view showing all widgets

## üöÄ **After Upload**

Once you've copied and committed the screenshots, let me know and I'll:
1. Help integrate them into the documentation
2. Create markdown with embedded images
3. Update the project status to include visual proof
4. Ensure everything is portfolio-ready
