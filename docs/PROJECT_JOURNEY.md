1. **Real Event Generation**: Created test event producers
2. **Dashboard Fixes**: Corrected widget configurations
3. **Validation Scripts**: Comprehensive deployment validation
4. **Screenshot Documentation**: Professional portfolio presentation

**Key Insight**: Working dashboards with real data essential for portfolio credibility

### **Iteration 3: Documentation & Knowledge Management**
**Challenge**: Process documentation accumulation creating navigation complexity
**Focus**: Sustainable documentation practices

**Documentation Evolution:**
- **Initial State**: Process docs scattered across root and docs folders
- **Problem Identified**: New team members struggling with navigation
- **Solution Designed**: Consolidation into operational guides and archived history
- **Sustainable Process**: Template for future iterations
