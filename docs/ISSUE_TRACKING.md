# üêõ Issue Tracking & Resolution Log

## üìã **Project Status Overview**
- **Project**: AWS Security Analytics Pipeline
- **Current Phase**: Validation & Documentation
- **Last Updated**: July 22, 2025
- **Overall Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - All major issues fixed

---

## üéØ **Resolved Issues**

### **Issue #1: CloudWatch Dashboards Showing "No Data Available"**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
- **Severity**: High
- **Date Identified**: July 22, 2025
- **Date Resolved**: July 22, 2025

**Problem:**
- All three CloudWatch dashboards were showing "No data available"
- Users couldn't validate pipeline functionality for portfolio demonstration

**Root Causes:**
1. **Lack of Real Event Data**: Pipeline was deployed but no test events were being processed
2. **Dashboard Configuration Issues**: Some widgets had incorrect configurations
3. **Metric Timing**: CloudWatch metrics have inherent delays

**Solutions Implemented:**
1. **Generated Test Events**: Created and ran `test_pipeline.py` to send real events through the pipeline
2. **Fixed Dashboard Configurations**: Updated widget JSON structures for proper rendering
3. **Added Real-time Status**: Created status widgets showing actual S3 object counts

**Validation:**
- ‚úÖ 12 S3 objects created successfully
- ‚úÖ Lambda invocations recorded
- ‚úÖ Kinesis stream processing confirmed

### **Issue #2: Security Metrics Dashboard Loading Failure**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
- **Severity**: High
- **Date Identified**: July 22, 2025
- **Date Resolved**: July 22, 2025

**Problem:**
- Security Metrics Dashboard would redirect to generic CloudWatch page
- Dashboard wouldn't load despite existing in AWS

**Root Cause:**
- Dashboard widget configuration used incorrect `"type": "number"` instead of `"type": "metric"`

**Solution:**
- Recreated dashboard with corrected JSON configuration
- Updated widget types to proper `"type": "metric"` format

**Files Modified:**
- `fixed_metrics_dashboard.json`
- Dashboard updated via AWS CLI

**Validation:**
- ‚úÖ Dashboard now loads correctly
- ‚úÖ All four metrics widgets display properly
- ‚úÖ Real-time data showing

---

### **Issue #3: Cost Tracking Dashboard Query Error**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Date Identified**: July 22, 2025
- **Date Resolved**: July 22, 2025

**Problem:**
- Cost tracking dashboard showed malformed CloudWatch Logs Insights query error

**Root Cause:**
- Incorrect syntax in CloudWatch Logs Insights query within dashboard configuration

**Solution:**
- Fixed query syntax in dashboard JSON
- Updated dashboard via AWS CLI using `cost_dashboard_fix.json`

**Validation:**
- ‚úÖ No more error messages
- ‚úÖ Dashboard renders properly
- ‚úÖ Resource utilization metrics display

---

### **Issue #4: S3 Data Lake Growth Showing "No Data"**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED with Workaround**
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Date Identified**: July 22, 2025
- **Date Resolved**: July 22, 2025

**Problem:**
- S3 Data Lake Growth widget consistently showed "No data available"

**Root Cause:**
- AWS S3 storage metrics (BucketSizeBytes, NumberOfObjects) are only reported daily
- New buckets may take 24-48 hours to show storage metrics

**Solution:**
- Added "Data Lake Status" text widget showing real-time S3 object count
- Kept original S3 metrics widget with explanation note
- Provides immediate validation that pipeline is working

**Files Modified:**
- `fixed_analytics_dashboard.json`
- Updated Security Analytics Dashboard

**Validation:**
- ‚úÖ Real-time status shows 12 objects in S3
- ‚úÖ Proof of pipeline functionality
- ‚úÖ Portfolio-ready demonstration

### **Issue #5: Python Environment Not Configured**
- **Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Date Identified**: July 22, 2025
- **Date Resolved**: July 22, 2025

**Problem:**
- Python not in system PATH
- Couldn't run test scripts to generate pipeline events

**Root Cause:**
- Python not installed or not properly configured in system PATH

**Solution:**
1. Installed Python via Chocolatey package manager
2. Installed required dependencies (boto3)
3. Successfully ran test event generation scripts

**Commands Used:**
```powershell
choco install python
pip install boto3
python test_pipeline.py
```

**Validation:**
- ‚úÖ Python working correctly
- ‚úÖ Test events successfully generated
- ‚úÖ Pipeline processing confirmed

---

## üîÑ **Ongoing Monitoring**

### **Items to Watch:**
1. **S3 Storage Metrics**: Should appear within 24-48 hours of bucket creation
2. **CloudWatch Metric Delays**: Normal 1-15 minute delays for various metric types
3. **Lambda Cold Starts**: May affect initial response times

### **Future Enhancements:**
1. **Custom Metrics**: Consider adding custom application metrics
2. **Alerting**: Set up CloudWatch alarms for key thresholds
3. **Cost Optimization**: Monitor and optimize resource usage
