# Security Checklist for AWS Security Analytics Pipeline

## üõ°Ô∏è Before Committing to Public Repository

### ‚úÖ Safe to Commit
- [ ] PowerShell scripts with generic logic
- [ ] Terraform configurations with placeholder values
- [ ] Documentation with sanitized examples
- [ ] Project structure and workflows
- [ ] Cost optimization configurations
- [ ] Dashboard configurations (anonymized)

### ‚ùå NEVER Commit
- [ ] AWS Account IDs (real)
- [ ] SSO URLs or Domain IDs
- [ ] Access Keys or Secret Keys
- [ ] Session Tokens
- [ ] Private Keys or Certificates
- [ ] User names or email addresses
- [ ] Internal hostnames or IP addresses

## üîç Security Verification Commands

```powershell
# Check for sensitive patterns before committing
git grep -i "643275918916" .          # Your account ID
git grep -i "d-90663772fc" .           # SSO domain
git grep -i "awsapps.com" .           # SSO URLs
git grep -i "AKIA" .                  # Access key pattern
git grep -i "aws_secret" .            # Secret key pattern
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Safe Usage Patterns

### Template Files (Public Safe)
```ini
# Safe - Uses placeholders
sso_account_id = YOUR_AWS_ACCOUNT_ID
sso_start_url = https://YOUR_SSO_DOMAIN.awsapps.com/start/#
```

### Local Configuration (Keep Private)
```ini
# Private - Real values in ~/.aws/config only
sso_account_id = 643275918916
sso_start_url = https://d-90663772fc.awsapps.com/start/#
```

## üìã Repository Security Status

### Current Repository State: ‚úÖ SECURE
- All AWS account IDs replaced with placeholders
- SSO URLs sanitized in documentation
- Scripts use environment variables and AWS profiles
- No hardcoded credentials anywhere

### Portfolio Demonstration Safe
- Shows technical expertise without exposing security details
- Hiring managers can see architecture and skills
- Technical implementation remains secure
- Cost optimization strategies are transparent

## üéØ Security Best Practices Demonstrated

1. **No Hardcoded Credentials**: All access via AWS profiles
2. **Least Privilege**: Uses specific roles and policies
3. **Environment Separation**: Clear dev/prod boundaries
4. **Encryption**: At rest and in transit
5. **Audit Logging**: CloudTrail and CloudWatch integration
6. **Cost Controls**: Budget alerts and resource limits

This repository demonstrates security-conscious development practices suitable for enterprise environments.
